# MortgageCalculator
Assignment Overview and Outcomes
For many Americans, calculating the monthly mortgage payment is an important step in the process of
owning a home. However, this calculation can be time-consuming and involves many different parts.
The goal of this assignment is to write a program that will estimate the monthly mortgage payment for a
user based on their inputs, assuming a fixed-rate mortgage (meaning the same amount is paid each
month). The program should also output the total mortgage paid, principal paid, and additional paid at
the end.
Program Inputs:
• Home price (in dollars)
• Down payment (in dollars)
• Length of loan (in months)
• Monthly interest rate (in percentage)
• Property tax rate (in percentage)
• Insurance rate (in percentage)
Program Outputs (all in dollars):
• Monthly mortgage payment
• Total paid
• Principle paid
• Additional paid (i.e., Total paid – principle paid)
